# HORSE POWER

![Logo](./logo.png)

Forge a thriving(?) civilization of not-very-colorful magical equines in this sandbox simulation.  Supporting up to thousands of workers, HORSE POWER has been known to send playtesters and developers alike into inescapable trances, unable to look away from the mesmerizing simulation on the screen in front of them. You have been warned.

## KNOWN BUG:
Workers who are farming will not recalculate their target position if it is unreachable, and they will get stuck trying to go to that location. I was unfortunately not able to fix this before the submission deadline, and I'm sad because that does affect gameplay - you're intended to be able to wall off the map into individual sections and have the workers still function, but unfortunately this bug renders that approach non-viable.

This was a submission for [Godot Wild Jam #68](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-68). Due to the nature of the game jam, this project got VERY dirty and hacky in some spots. Please don't judge me.

Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android clients are supported, but not iOS (sorry).

Playable at [itch.io](https://deltaryz.itch.io/horse-power) and [horsepower.deltaryz.com](https://horsepower.deltaryz.com)
