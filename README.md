# HORSE POWER

Forge a thriving(?) civilization of not-very-colorful magical equines in this sandbox simulation.  Supporting up to thousands of workers, HORSE POWER has been known to send playtesters and developers alike into inescapable trances, unable to look away from the mesmerizing simulation on the screen in front of them. You have been warned.
